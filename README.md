# Source SDK 2013 — GMOD Tools X64 Mod
## THIS PROJECT IS NOT FINISHED!
Source code for **Source SDK 2013 GMOD (64-bit)** — custom-optimized build tools for **VBSP**, **VVIS**, and **VRAD**, primarily targeting performance improvements, GPU acceleration, and modern compiler compatibility.

This repository is an experimental fork based on [Ficool2’s Source SDK 2013 fork](https://github.com/ficool2/source-sdk-2013), adapted specifically for **Garry’s Mod (64-bit)**.  
It serves as a **research and testing environment**, not a finalized SDK release.

---

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to explore how the classic Source Engine build tools can be modernized to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, modern compilers, and even GPU acceleration through **OpenCL**.  

While this repository contains fully compilable tools, it is **not intended for end users** who simply want improved compilers.  
Instead, it aims to document experiments, test optimizations, and demonstrate potential evolutions of the original Source SDK pipeline.

## Development Activity Notice

This repository (and others under my account) is currently maintained at a **very slow and irregular pace**.  
Development progress may be **paused for long periods** due to lack of priority and available time.  
Updates, commits, or experimental changes may therefore take **months or even years** before being published.  
The goal remains to preserve and document my work over time, even if active development is infrequent.


## Current Status

### VVIS_GPU (OpenCL)
The GPU-accelerated version of **VVIS** is **currently on hold**.  
With the release of **[VVIS++ and other tools by Ficool2](https://ficool2.github.io/HammerPlusPlus-Website/tools.html)**, CPU-based visibility calculations are already significantly optimized.  
As a result, the OpenCL branch remains an **experimental concept**, to be revisited later for research or hybrid CPU/GPU tests.

### VRAD
Work is in progress to refactor and improve **VRAD**:
- A new **verbose output system** will log details into a separate file.
- Additional **command-line options** are planned for lighting analysis and debugging.
- Potential exploration of **GPU-based bounce lighting**.

### VBSP
Minor profiling and structural tests are being made to analyze compile-time behavior and potential I/O bottlenecks.

## Goals

This repository is **not a downloadable SDK** or a ready-to-use replacement for official tools.  
It is meant for developers and enthusiasts who want to:
- Understand how Source tools can be **modernized and optimized**.
- Experiment with **OpenCL integration** in legacy C++ codebases.
- Study compile-time and lighting performance behaviors.
- Follow the evolution of tests, experiments, and refactors over time.

Future updates will also aim to **consolidate all dependencies** into a **single executable** (e.g., `vvis.exe`, `vrad.exe` without external DLLs), ensuring easier compatibility with **Garry’s Mod**.

⚠️ **Note:**  
This project is **Windows-only** for now. Linux support is not native and will be considered later if requested, along with dedicated compatibility explanations or adaptations.

## Author Notes

This repository represents the **beginning of a long-term experimental project** to modernize, analyze, and optimize the Source build tools for Garry’s Mod and beyond.  
The focus is on **research**, **learning**, and **technical curiosity** rather than providing ready-to-use binaries.

> “This is just the beginning of a long journey of experiments and ideas.”
